# Calorie Burnt Prediction 🏃‍♂️🔥

This project aims to predict the number of calories burnt based on physical attributes and exercise data using machine learning models. The goal is to help users understand how different factors like age, weight, duration, and heart rate impact calorie expenditure.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Predicting calorie burn can be useful for fitness tracking, personalized diet planning, and health monitoring. The project uses regression algorithms to build a predictive model from user data.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used includes the following features:

- Age
- Gender
- Height (cm)
- Weight (kg)
- Duration (minutes)
- Heart Rate (bpm)
- Body Temperature (°C)
- Calories Burnt

> Dataset Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) or other open-source fitness datasets.
